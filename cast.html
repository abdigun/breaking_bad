						Bryan Cranston won three consecutive Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Walter White. He holds the honor of being the first actor in a cable series, and the second lead actor in the history of the Emmy Awards, to receive three consecutive wins. In 2012 Cranston’s performance earned him a fourth Emmy nomination, a Television Critics Association Award, three Golden Globe nominations and a Screen Actors Guild Award.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						On the big screen, Cranston won a second Screen Actors Guild Award this year for his co-starring role in the 2012 Oscar-winning Best Picture Argo, essaying the role of CIA operative Jack O’Donnell opposite star-director Ben Affleck.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						He is currently in production on Legendary Pictures’ remake of Godzilla starring opposite Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. He will also voice a character in DreamWorks’ Kung Fu Panda 3.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Last year, Cranston was heard as the voice of Vitaly in Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted, which grossed over $730 million worldwide. He also starred in Len Wiseman’s remake of Total Recall, Adam Shankman’s Rock of Ages and Nicolas Winding Refn's critically acclaimed film Drive, opposite Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan. Cranston's additional feature film credits include: Contagion, John Carter, Larry Crowne, The Lincoln Lawyer, Little Miss Sunshine, Seeing Other People, Saving Private Ryan and That Thing You Do!
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Born into a show business family and raised in Southern California, Cranston made his acting debut at the age of 8 in a United Way commercial. It wasn't until he finished college that acting became a serious consideration. While on a cross-country motorcycle trip with his brother, he discovered community theater and began exploring every aspect of the stage. Soon, he was cast in a summer stock company.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Cranston returned to Los Angeles and quickly landed a role on the television movie Love Without End, which led to his being signed as an original cast member of ABC's Loving. He went on to appear in numerous television roles, including a seven-year run as Hal on FOX's Malcolm in the Middle, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe and three Emmy Awards; the recurring role of dentist Tim Whatley on Seinfeld; HBO's acclaimed miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, as Buzz Aldrin; and the made-for-television movie I Know My First Name is Steven, among others. He has also guest-starred on numerous TV programs.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Cranston continues to pursue his love for theater whenever possible. Credits include: The God of Hell, Chapter Two, The Taming of the Shrew, A Doll's House, Eastern Standard, Wrestlers, Barefoot in the Park and The Steven Weed Show, for which he won a Drama-Logue Award.
					</p>

					</p>

						If you don’t already, within the next year you will know Aaron Paul’s name. Many already recognize him as meth-kingpin-apprentice-seeking-moral-redemption Jesse Pinkman, as he continues to slay audiences by seamlessly oscillating from his famous “YO, bitch!” catchphrase to his tearjerker waterworks moments. Already twice a Primetime Emmy Award winner for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, Paul is set to become a part of Hollywood’s next generation of movie stars.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						What has perhaps been the most telling aspect of Paul’s career has been his inherent ability as an actor to become a storytelling chameleon. A native of Idaho, he’s remained true to his humble roots, choosing roles he’s deeply invested in bringing to life. Fans who followed him in his early career were awed at his chilling turn with Tony Goldwyn, Monica Potter and Garret Dillahunt in producer Wes Craven’s psychological remake The Last House on the Left after his quiet performance in HBO’s well-received series Big Love, where he convinced Amanda Seyfried’s character to leave behind her polygamous family for their loving, monogamous relationship.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Still others may have noticed him in 2012’s Smashed< with Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Octavia Spencer, Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally. Winner of the Special Jury Prize at Sundance, the film about the disintegration of a couple’s relationship based on their mutual love of alcohol had Peter Travers of Rolling Stone calling Paul “dynamite,” cementing his status even further as a stellar actor on the rise.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Audiences will have even more Aaron Paul to look forward to with the addition of two upcoming releases: the adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel A Long Way Down -- opposite Pierce Brosnan and Toni Collette -- about a group of friends who make a pact to kill themselves on New Year’s Eve and Decoding Annie Parker -- alongside Helen Hunt, Samantha Morton and Richard Schiff -- in which Paul joins breast cancer patient Annie Parker (Morton), who, despite the beliefs of the medical establishment, stops at nothing to solve the mystery behind her illness. While his roles have run the gamut --from feature to television to the Korn “Thoughtless” music video for which people still remember him -- what hasn’t changed has been his emotionally gut-wrenching performances.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Soon, however, audiences will see another side of Paul when he stars in DreamWorks’ and Steven Spielberg’s thrilling joy ride Need for Speed. Currently shooting across the country, he is joined by Dominic Cooper, Imogen Poots and Michael Keaton in this live-action imagining of the popular Electronic Arts video game.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Paul currently resides in Los Angeles. When not working, he can often be found enjoying concerts, relaxing with a glass of Bushmills

						Just like his character on the show, RJ Mitte has cerebral palsy, although Mitte’s is a milder form of the disability. His other credits include the upcoming fantasy thriller feature film House of Last Things and the documentary film CinemAbility, which takes a detailed look at the evolution of disability in entertainment and features a who’s who of Hollywood, including Ben Affleck, Jamie Foxx, Gary Sinise and David Milch, among others. He recently had a guest-starring role on the CBS hit Vegas. Mitte also served as executive producer for Vanished: The Tara Calico Story, which had its debut at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Mitte is involved with several organizations that raise awareness of equality and diversity. He is the Youth Spokesperson for the National Disability Institute’s Real Economic Impact Tour, which works to improve the financial situation of low-income persons with disabilities. He is a spokesperson for I AM PWD, the tri-union campaign (SAG, AFTRA and AEA) which advocates for actors with disabilities, and for Beyond Diversity—The Future Is Now. As a guest speaker at high schools, colleges and universities around the country, Mitte openly talks about the ways he has overcome obstacles and how he has achieved his goals. In 2011 he became a Celebrity Youth Ambassador for United Cerebral Palsy, an organization which educates, advocates and provides support limits for people with a spectrum of disabilities.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						One hot-button issue that Mitte has recently become vocal about is the prevention of bullying. Upon hearing that bullying was at the root of several teen suicides in 2010, Mitte began speaking out on the topic via YouTube, a statement to the press and in interviews. He has since been a featured guest speaker at an anti-bullying town hall discussion at the NAPT Annual Conference for school transportation professionals and begun working with PACER’s National Center for Bullying Prevention on a national campaign designed to engage and educate those who see bullying -- leveraging peer-to-peer support.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Mitte spent much of his childhood in both Austin, TX, and Lafayette, LA, where he learned to deal with and overcome many of the challenges presented by his cerebral palsy.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						In 2005, he accompanied his younger sister on a trip to Los Angeles and was encouraged by a talent agent to try acting. Early in his career, Mitte worked as a background actor on the TV series Hannah Montana and Everybody Hates Chris. Mitte’s big break came when he was given the opportunity to audition for Breaking Bad.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						As a child, Mitte learned the value of giving back, spending time working with his grandfather’s philanthropic organization and partnering with Habitat groups to build houses around the world for communities devastated by natural disasters and poverty. These experiences helped set the backdrop for his future advocacy work in Hollywood.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						In his spare time, Mitte enjoys physical activities like hiking Runyon Canyon, an L.A. hot spot, and ballroom dancing. Mitte’s ambitions include directing, producing and finding work that will help him grow as an actor.

In 2004, she landed her breakout television role playing Martha Bullock on HBO’s seminal show Deadwood, later receiving a SAG Award® nomination for Best Ensemble Cast in 2006. Gunn’s association with Deadwood creator David Milch began early on when she first worked on his hit drama NYPD Blue, giving a memorable performance as Kimmy, a junkie longing to escape New York.

Kelley’s The Practice, delivering a notable turn as ADA Jean Ward opposite Dylan McDermott and Lara Flynn Boyle. Her extensive television credits also include starring roles in several made-for-television movies and major guest-starring appearances on such hit shows as Six Feet Under, ER, Boston Legal, Law & Order and Seinfeld.

Gunn is workshopping a powerful role in a new indie film this June at the Directors Lab at the Sundance Institute.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Gunn is also a highly regarded actress of the stage. In 2009 and 2011, she created leading roles in two world premiere productions: photojournalist Sarah Goodwin in Donald Margulies’ Time Stands Still and the title role in Alan Alda’s Radiance: The Passion of Marie Curie. Both roles received great acclaim under the direction of Daniel Sullivan at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles. In 1999, she played Isabella in Measure for Measure at the Ahmanson Theatre, helmed by the famed director Sir Peter Hall. In 1997, Gunn made her Broadway debut alongside Roger Rees in The Rehearsal at the Roundabout Theatre and starred in the 1995 American premiere of Terry Johnson’s Hysteria, directed by Phyllida Lloyd at the Mark Taper Forum. Early in her career, Gunn built an impressive resume performing on stage in Chicago. She garnered exceptional reviews in Uncommon Ground at the Northlight Theatre, and starred opposite Jeremy Piven in Keith Reddin’s Peacekeeper at the American Blues Theatre. While still an undergraduate at Northwestern University, she landed her first professional acting role, playing Lucy Lockit in the critically acclaimed production of The Beggar’s Opera at the Court Theatre.

						Actor Mark Margolis is most recently on screen as Hector “Tio” Salamanca on AMC’s hit Breaking Bad, in which he plays a former drug kingpin who is unable to speak or walk due to the lingering effects of a stroke.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Margolis was born in November 1939 in Philadelphia, and moved to New York City at a young age to pursue a career in acting. Under the wing of famed acting teacher Stella Adler, who Margolis sees as a “larger than life” influence on his work, he launched his career with an early focus on theater, where he earned major roles in large-scale productions including Infidel Caesar, a Broadway show based on Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. Shortly thereafter, Margolis founded Blue Dome, a touring theater company that performed avant-garde productions, including Antonin Artaud’s The Conquest of Mexico, at colleges and universities across the United States, largely funded by the New York State Council on the Arts.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Margolis then returned to theater in New York, and appeared in more than fifty plays in New York’s Off-Broadway including Uncle Sam, and The Golem. While he is more focused on film and television these days, he “does plays when he cannot live without them,” which led him to his most recent role as Bernie Madoff in an upstate New York production entitled Imagining Madoff.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Margolis has had many recurring roles on television in addition to Breaking Bad including Oz, The Equalizer and Kings, as well as guest appearances on a number of popular shows including Californication, Person of Interest and Crossing Jordan.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Margolis has an equally illustrious film career that spans over thirty years and includes seventy films, many of which have been critically acclaimed. He is best known for playing Alberto in Scarface and for appearances in all four of Darren Aronofsky’s films, including The Wrestler and Pi, Aronofsky’s first film and one that Margolis considers a favorite.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Margolis was recently nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Guest Performer on Television for his role in Breaking Bad. He credits his ability to play the critically praised Tio on the show, in part, to a family member who he observed and cared for following a paralyzing stroke, a fate similar to that Tio suffers.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Upcoming for Margolis is an appearance in Stand Up Guys opposite Christopher Walken and Al Pacino, which just wrapped in Los Angeles.
					</p>

					<p class="desc">
						Margolis resides in New York City with his wife Jacqueline. They have one son, Morgan Margolis, the CEO of Knitting Factory Entertainment in Los Angeles. He is a lifetime member of the Actors Studio and conducts occasional acting workshops for young actors in New York City.
